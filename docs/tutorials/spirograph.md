[Spirograph Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph)

The `spirograph` function takes three arguments: `r`, `k` and `l`

* `r` is a scaling parameter which modifies the radius of the spirograph
* `k` is the size ratio of the 'inner' circle of a spirograph to the 'outer' circle
* `l` is the distance from the drawing point to the centre of the 'inner' circle
